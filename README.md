# Buzz About

[![Build Status][Angular Tests badge]][Angular Tests page]

</div align="center">


Buzz About is a participatory simulation that teaches people about native pollinators of Minnesota.

Buzz About is a web app built with [Angular][] and [Firebase][].

## Usage

<!-- These instructions are necessarily quite broad, but let me know if there's anything you think we should add! -->

To set up a simulation, you'll need to print out [these markers][AR Markers] and set them up around the room. Markers 1&ndash;16 are flowers; the rest are pollinator nests.

Once you've set up the markers, you can go to [buzzabout.app][] to host a session. When you create a session, you'll be given a join code; if participants open [buzzabout.app/play][] on their phone or tablet, they can type in the join code to play the simulation with you.

In the simulation, each participant acts as a different pollinator, trying to collect pollen from the flowers. Make sure you bring enough pollen back to your nest before the time runs out!
